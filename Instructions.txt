Welcome to 5-Card Poker! 

You will be facing the menacing, all powerful, random bots... and three of them!
Pretty much how it goes is that you will be playing regular poker, and there is some
certain functionality that we have given to make your experience better. Every player
will have the ability to exchange their cards one at a time! This is just to make this game
more enjoyable: a good, random hand is hard to come by, so we will just speed up the process
to let you build your own quicker! 

There is a hud with all the functionality you will use, you can exchange cards (although, only
once per card), and you can bet, match, or fold just like regular Poker. You can just use
the mouse to click each of these buttons and have fun!

For folding, we will also let you keep your chips if you fold! This is to accommodate for 
the random players, as they are set to not fold a lot, so in the chance that they do fold 
they should be safe. 

A little note about the hud: if you click done before matching the bet, you automatically fold.

Also, you will get a history of all the outcomes per round on the BetHistory.txt file! Note that
this bet history assumes that you finish the game to the end. If you end the program early, the 
history will not reset by itself, so play till the end!

What you see on the table is the previous bet of a player, as well as their current chips. Once
you see the bet of the round, you can decide to match or not!

Your goal is to build the best hand, and win all of the chips on the table. Once you do that,
you will win not only the rounds, but also the whole game! Good luck building!

Whenever you want to play another round or another game, just click the button on the top-left!

I hope you have fun playing Poker: these random bots are good!
